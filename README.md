DBF is a small fast library for reading dBase, xBase, Clipper and FoxPro
database files

* Report bugs: <http://github.com/infused/dbf/issues>
* Questions: Email <mailto:keithm@infused.org> and put DBF somewhere in the
  subject line
* Change log: <https://github.com/infused/dbf/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>

NOTE: beginning with version 3 we have dropped support for Ruby 1.8 and 1.9. If you need support for older Rubies, please use 2.0.x (https://github.com/infused/dbf/tree/2_stable)

## Compatibility

DBF is tested to work with the following versions of Ruby:

* MRI Ruby 2.0.x, 2.1.x, 2.2.x, 2.3.x
* JRuby head

## Installation

Install the gem manually:

```
gem install dbf
```

Or add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dbf'
```

## Basic Usage

Open a DBF file using a path:

```ruby
require 'dbf'
widgets = DBF::Table.new("widgets.dbf")
```

Open a DBF file using an IO object:

```ruby
data = File.open('widgets.dbf')
widgets = DBF::Table.new(data)
```

Open a DBF by passing in raw data (wrap the raw data with a StringIO):

```ruby
widgets = DBF::Table.new(StringIO.new('raw binary data'))
```

Enumerate all records

```ruby
widgets.each do |record|
  puts record.name
  puts record.email
end
```

Find a single record

```ruby
widget = widgets.find(6)
```

Note that find() will return nil if the requested record has been deleted
and not yet pruned from the database.

The value for a attribute can be accessed via element reference in one of three
ways

```ruby
widget["SlotNumber"]   # original field name in dbf file
widget['slot_number']  # underscored field name string
widget[:slot_number]   # underscored field name symbol
```

Attributes can also be accessed as method using the underscored field name

```ruby
widget.slot_number
```

Get a hash of all attributes. The keys are the original column names.

```ruby
widget.attributes
# => {"Name" => "Thing1", "SlotNumber" => 1}
```

Search for records using a simple hash format. Multiple search criteria are
ANDed. Use the block form if the resulting recordset could be large, otherwise
all records will be loaded into memory.

```ruby
# find all records with slot_number equal to s42
widgets.find(:all, slot_number: 's42') do |widget|
  # the record will be nil if deleted, but not yet pruned from the database
  if widget
    puts widget.serial_number
  end
end

# find the first record with slot_number equal to s42
widgets.find :first, slot_number: 's42'

# find record number 10
widgets.find(10)
```

## Enumeration

DBF::Table is a Ruby Enumerable. This means you can use any Enumerable method.
This means that you get a bunch of traversal, searching and sorting methods
for free. For example, let's get only records created before January 1st, 2015:

```ruby
widgets.select { |w| w.created_date < Date.new(2015, 1, 1) }
```

Or custom sorting:

```ruby
widgets.sort_by { |w| w.created_date }
```


## Encodings (Code Pages)

dBase supports encoding non-english characters in different formats.
Unfortunately, the format used is not always set, so you may have to specify it
manually. For example, you have a DBF file from Russia and you are getting bad
data. Try using the 'Russion OEM' encoding:

```ruby
table = DBF::Table.new('dbf/books.dbf', nil, 'cp866')
```

See
[doc/supported_encodings.csv](docs/supported_encodings.csv)
for a full list of supported encodings.

## Options

You can pass other options when initializing.

Currently supports:

* `repare_record_count`: Boolean, default `false`. Recalculate record count rather than using record count in header. This is useful if your dbf file may be corrupted and record count in the header is incorrect.

```
table = DBF::Table.new('dbf/books.dbf', nil, nil, repare_record_count: true)
```

## Migrating to ActiveRecord

An example of migrating a DBF book table to ActiveRecord using a migration:

```ruby
require 'dbf'

class Book < ActiveRecord::Base; end

class CreateBooks < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    table = DBF::Table.new('db/dbf/books.dbf')
    eval(table.schema)

    Book.reset_column_information
    table.each do |record|
      Book.create(title: record.title, author: record.author)
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :books
  end
end
```

If you have initalized the DBF::Table with raw data, you will need to set the
table name manually with:

```ruby
table.name = 'my_table_name'
```

## Migrating to Sequel

An example of migrating a DBF book table to Sequel using a migration:

```ruby
require 'dbf'

class Book < Sequel::Model; end

Sequel.migration do
  up do
    table = DBF::Table.new('db/dbf/books.dbf')
    eval(table.schema(:sequel, true)) # passing true to limit output to create_table() only

    Book.reset_column_information
    table.each do |record|
      Book.create(title: record.title, author: record.author)
    end
  end

  down do
    drop_table(:books)
  end
end
```

If you have initalized the DBF::Table with raw data, you will need to set the
table name manually with:

```ruby
table.name = 'my_table_name'
```

## Command-line utility

A small command-line utility called dbf is installed along with the gem.

    $ dbf -h
    usage: dbf [-h|-s|-a] filename
      -h = print this message
      -v = print the version number
      -s = print summary information
      -a = create an ActiveRecord::Schema
      -r = create a Sequel Migration
      -c = create a csv file

Create an executable ActiveRecord schema:

    dbf -a books.dbf > books_schema.rb

Create an executable Sequel schema:

    dbf -r books.dbf > migrate/001_create_books.rb

Dump all records to a CSV file:

    dbf -c books.dbf > books.csv

## Reading a Visual Foxpro database (v8, v9)

A special Database::Foxpro class is available to read Visual Foxpro container files (.dbc-files). When using this class,
long field names are supported and tables can be referenced without using names.

```ruby
require 'dbf'

contacts = DBF::Database::Foxpro.new('contactdatabase.dbc').contacts
my_contact = contacts.record(1).spouses_interests
```


## dBase version compatibility

The basic dBase data types are generally supported well. Support for the
advanced data types in dbase V and FoxPro are still experimental or not
supported. If you have insight into how any of the unsupported data types are
implemented, please give me a shout. FoxBase/dBase II files are not supported
at this time.

See
[doc/supported_types.markdown](docs/supported_types.markdown)
for a full list of supported column types.

## Limitations

* DBF is read-only
* Index files are not utilized
